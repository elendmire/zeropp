"""Unit tests for the reusable functions in scripts/07_data_size_sweep.py that
Task 5 imports per this plan's Interfaces section (find_breakpoint, sample_contiguous,
sample_random, compute_metrics, fit_predict_local_emos).

scripts/07_data_size_sweep.py is not an importable package module (its filename starts
with a digit, so `import scripts.07_data_size_sweep` is a syntax error) — it is loaded
here via importlib.util.spec_from_file_location, the same mechanism Task 5's own code
will need to reuse these functions. Only top-level imports/definitions execute on load;
main() only runs under `if __name__ == "__main__"`, so importing is side-effect-free.

Added in fix-round-1 (revised R3a): find_breakpoint previously had zero direct tests
despite being flagged as a reusable interface Task 5 imports, and two real direction
bugs in code that CALLS find_breakpoint were only caught by eyeballing a figure. These
5 tests cover find_breakpoint's own contract directly and mechanically: a known
crossing, no crossing, a NaN row, a non-monotonic curve, and a single-element array.
