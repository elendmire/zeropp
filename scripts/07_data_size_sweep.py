"""Training-data-size breakpoint curve (RQ2): refit EMOS at increasing amounts of
reforecast training data, under two sampling arms and two pooling variants; TimesFM-3
and raw ensemble are zero-shot / N-independent and reused as flat reference lines from
the already-persisted Phase 2 results, restricted to the exact same evaluation
instances EMOS is scored on (see "Instance-set join" below — fix-round-1 finding 1).

"N days" is operationalized as k = round(N / DAYS_PER_CASE) (year_idx, time_idx)
issue-date pairs out of the full 20-year x 209-date reforecast archive, where
DAYS_PER_CASE is MEASURED directly from the archive (see below), not assumed. Two
arms pick WHICH k pairs:
  - contiguous (primary): the k pairs closest in time to the test period, working
    backward — simulates a real newly-deployed station's limited, chronologically
    contiguous history (small N sees roughly one season, not all four).
  - random (secondary, 5 seeds, mean +/- std reported): k pairs drawn uniformly at
    random from the full archive — gives artificial full-season coverage even at small
    N. The gap between the two arms' curves is itself a reported finding about the
    value of seasonal coverage, not a discrepancy to explain away.
See this plan's Task 4 "Before You Begin" for the full rationale.

Step 0 finding, RE-MEASURED directly in fix-round-1 (2026-09-03, SSH altay) after
review flagged the original ISSUE_DATES_PER_YEAR=209 constant as wrong. Measured via
`len(ds.year)`, `len(ds.time)`, `ds.time.values[0]`/`[-1]`, and `np.diff` on the raw
archive: `len(ds.year)=20`, `len(ds.time)=209`, `ds.time` spans
2017-01-02T00:00:00 to 2018-12-31T00:00:00 (728.0 days exactly), with `np.diff`
alternating 3-day/4-day steps (median 3.5 days) — i.e. the archive's 209 "time"
values are ONE ~2-year template cycle of issue-date LABELS, re-used identically
across all 20 analog years (the separate "year" dimension), not 209 dates repeated
once per analog year. MEASURED DAYS_PER_CASE = 728.0 / 209 = 3.4833 days/case (see
the DAYS_PER_CASE constant below) — NOT the previously assumed 365/209 = 1.746. The
original constant silently doubled every "N days" label's real case count and halved
every reported "calendar days" figure; every k and every calendar-day-equivalent
number in this task's report was re-derived from this measured constant.

Ascending time_idx = later in the ~2-year cycle is CONFIRMED real (real datetime64
values, measured above). The separate "year" coordinate (int64, 1..20, bare
analog-year enumeration) has NO confirmed real calendar meaning — its polarity
("ascending year_idx = more recent analog year") was NOT verified. Its impact is
bounded, not "confirmed safe" and not "unbounded": every tested N whose k stays
within a single year_idx block (k <= 209, the archive's per-year_idx pair count) is
SAFE regardless of year_idx polarity, because contiguous sampling within one block
depends only on time_idx ordering, which WAS verified. With the corrected
DAYS_PER_CASE, the tested N values map to k = 9 (N=30), 26 (N=90), 105 (N=365),
314 (N=1095), 4180 ("full", measured directly, independent of any polarity). Only
N=1095 (k=314 > 209) spans multiple year_idx blocks and is therefore the one tested
point whose training-data identity could differ under the opposite year_idx polarity;
"full" uses every pair regardless of ordering, so polarity is irrelevant there
too. See the task report's "Fix round 1 (revised)" section for the full statement.

Instance-set join (fix-round-1 finding 1): `results/phase2_comparison_raw.parquet`'s
raw_ensemble/emos/tsfm3 rows are already restricted, by `04_run_tsfm.py`, to test
instances with sufficient clean lookback context for TimesFM-3 (a strict subset of
`build_test_long_table`'s full instance set). Comparing EMOS metrics computed on the
FULL test set against tsfm3/raw_ensemble metrics computed on that FILTERED subset
silently compares two different evaluation sets. Fixed here by inner-joining EMOS's
test instances onto the parquet's (station_id, valid_time, step_hours) instance keys
BEFORE computing any EMOS metric, so every method in every row of this sweep's output
is scored on the identical instance set. Instance counts for both sides and the
matched intersection are printed and included in the task report.

EMOS is fit two ways at each N: "pooled" (one global model across all stations, as in
Phase 2) and "local" (one model per station, fit only on that station's rows in the
subsample). Local EMOS needs >= LOCAL_EMOS_MIN_ROWS rows per station to fit reliably
(4 free parameters); at small N most stations won't have enough contiguous rows, so the
local curve is reported only over the stations it could actually cover, with that
coverage fraction reported alongside it — never silently filled in or extrapolated.
`fit_predict_local_emos`'s coverage fraction denominator is the number of unique
stations in the TEST set (fix-round-1 finding 5 — it was previously the number of
unique stations in the training subset, which is the wrong population and can hide
dropped test stations if train/test station sets ever differ).

Reforecasts have 11 ensemble members (germany_ensemble_reforecasts_t2m.nc); the test-
period forecasts EMOS is evaluated against have 51. ens_var computed from 11 members is
a noisier (higher-variance) estimator of the true ensemble spread than one from 51 would
be, at every N equally — this is a fixed property of the training archive, not something
that changes with N, and is not corrected here. Documented as a limitation in the task
report, not fixed in code (no clean fix exists without re-simulating the ensemble).

DRN (Rasp & Lerch 2018, Task 5): a third trained method added to the contiguous arm
only, alongside emos_pooled/emos_local, on the identical post-join test_X/obs_values/
test_station_ids. DRN's per-station embedding already models station-specific structure
the way emos_local does, so there is no separate local/pooled DRN split -- one
method="drn" curve is enough. The random arm and multi-seed treatment stay EMOS-only
(out of scope for DRN, same scope note as emos_local's random-arm exclusion). DRN's
training seed is config.data_size_sweep_seeds[0] (a real config value, not a new
hardcoded seed). DRN participates in the crps/coverage_80pct breakpoints (same
tsfm3 reference as emos_pooled/emos_local) but not interval_width_k, for the identical
"sharpness has no inherent direction" reason those two already follow.

Fix round 1 (task 5 review) A: every row for a method that actually fits a model
carries a "fit_seconds" column (wall-clock time.perf_counter() around that
method's fit()+predict_quantiles() call at that N) -- DRN retrains from scratch at
every N up to N=full's ~4.28M rows with a FIXED epoch budget regardless of N (see
DRN's class docstring), so the scaling story (does DRN's wall-clock cost grow with
N the way EMOS's does, or does the fixed-epoch design make it flatter/steeper) is
itself a reportable finding, not just the metrics. "fit_seconds" is None for rows
where nothing was actually fit at that row (N=0 undefined rows, the N=full random-
arm reuse rows since no refit happens there by construction, and the N-independent
raw_ensemble/tsfm3 reference rows, which are zero-shot/already-computed).
