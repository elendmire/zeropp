#   ./scripts/build_refs.sh                      # all blocks

  # A DOI that fails to resolve on doi.org's end often still returns HTTP 200
  # with an HTML "DOI Not Found" error page rather than an HTTP error code --
  # and that page can contain a line starting with "@" (e.g. a CSS @media
  # rule), which used to fool a naive "does any line start with @" check into
  # silently accepting the HTML as a valid bib entry. Verified on this exact
  # dataset: this is what happened to a truncated legacy-AMS DOI, and the fix
  # was tightened further after that first fix still relied on only two of
  # three independent signals -- now ALL THREE must hold, not just one or two:
  # (a) the first non-blank character of the body is "@"; (b) the body
  # contains an actual doi/DOI field (an HTML error page could in principle
  # mention the string "doi" without being a bib entry, and a genuine bib
  # entry always carries one); (c) the body contains no HTML markers anywhere.
  # Any single one of these failing is treated as a failed fetch.
