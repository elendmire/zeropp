"""One-time backfill (final-review fix round, item 3): `results/phase2_comparison_raw.parquet`
predates `zeropp.eval.results.write_result` (Task 1) -- it is written directly via
`results_df.to_parquet(RESULTS_PATH, index=False)` in `scripts/04_run_tsfm.py` -- and was
never given a provenance sidecar. Every other results/ file has one; this one, the file
every later Phase 3 number ultimately derives from, did not.

write_result() requires the actual DataFrame (it writes {name}.parquet itself, unmodified,
alongside {name}.json) -- there is no metadata-only mode. This script reads the existing
parquet and passes it straight through write_result with the SAME name, so the parquet's
bytes are re-written (pandas/pyarrow-serialized, expected to be content-equivalent -- not
byte-identical to the original file, since it goes through a fresh to_parquet call) but a
real .json sidecar is produced for the first time.

Run once, on altay, after syncing this fix round's code:
    python scripts/_backfill_phase2_sidecar.py
Not part of the regular scripts/01-08 pipeline -- intentionally unnumbered so it does not
look like a repeatable step in the normal run order.
