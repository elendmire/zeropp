"""Investigation 1 (docs/references/priority123_investigation_report.md,
"is the 0-24h nowcasting advantage a real architectural advantage, or just an
unfair information asymmetry?"): TimesFM-3 receives the last ~40 observations
plus NWP ensemble-mean/spread as covariates at every lead time; plain EMOS
receives ONLY ens_mean/ens_var, no observation history at all. At very short
leads (0-24h) the most recent observation is close to a perfect predictor
(strong persistence), so TimesFM-3's short-lead CRPS advantage over EMOS
could be substantially explained by TimesFM-3 having access to information
EMOS structurally lacks, rather than by anything architectural.

This script builds a "persistence-augmented EMOS"
(zeropp.models.emos.PersistenceAugmentedEMOS: mu = a + b*ens_mean + e*last_obs,
sigma unchanged from plain EMOS) restricted to the 0-24h lead-time bucket ONLY
(step_hours in {0, 6, 12, 18} -- this project's LEAD_TIME_BUCKETS[0], see
scripts/08_lead_time_grouped_analysis.py), fit on the training reforecast
archive (never on test-set information), and compares it against:
  (a1) plain EMOS-pooled (lead-pooled training, full N) -- the number
       docs/references/priority123_investigation_report.md's brief explicitly
       points to, already persisted in
       results/phase3_lead_time_bucketed_sweep.parquet (n_days="full", bucket
       0-24h).
  (a2) plain EMOS bucket-specific (trained ONLY on 0-24h-bucket-restricted
       reforecast rows, full N) -- already persisted in
       results/phase3_lead_time_grouped_emos.parquet. This is the more
       directly comparable baseline for isolating last_obs's effect (same
       training-data lead-time scope as the persistence-augmented model
       below; only difference is the extra predictor), so it is refit HERE
       on the identical post-join row set the persistence model uses, for an
       apples-to-apples "does adding last_obs help" delta.
  (b) TimesFM-3 (zero-shot), 0-24h bucket -- same source file as (a1).

=== step_hours=0: real forecast lead, or degenerate analysis time? ===

Checked directly (this task, altay, 2026-09):
  1. Raw NetCDF CF metadata (germany_ensemble_forecasts_t2m.nc's `step`
     coordinate): standard_name="forecast_period", long_name="time since
     forecast_reference_time", units="hours", value 0 for the first step.
     This is the archive's own definition of step_hours=0 as a genuine T+0
     forecast (valid at the same instant as issuance), not a flag for
     "already-assimilated / equals the observation."
  2. Empirically (results/phase3_lead_time_breakdown.parquet): if step_hours=0
     forecasts were degenerate (forecast == obs), CRPS there would be near
     zero for every method. Instead: raw_ensemble CRPS at step_hours=0
     (1.2624 K) is WORSE than at step_hours=6 (1.0932 K); EMOS CRPS at
     step_hours=0 (1.1369 K) is likewise worse than at step_hours=6
     (0.9671 K); TimesFM-3's CRPS at step_hours=0 (0.9195 K) is essentially
     unchanged from step_hours=6 (0.9188 K), showing no special "free win"
     either. raw_ensemble's coverage@80% at step_hours=0 (0.2374) is exactly
     as badly under-dispersed as every other short lead, not near 1.0 as a
     degenerate/trivial case would show.
  CONCLUSION: step_hours=0 is a real, non-degenerate forecast lead time and
  IS INCLUDED in this script's 0-24h bucket headline comparison.

Including it correctly, however, requires care in the last_obs CONSTRUCTION
below (not in whether it belongs in the bucket): at step_hours=0, issue_time
== valid_time, so "the observation at issue_time" IS the observation being
predicted -- using it as last_obs would be pure leakage, not persistence. See
build_train_last_obs()/build_test_last_obs() for how this is avoided (a
genuinely earlier observation is used instead, at valid_time - 6h, both for
train and test), with a strict "never after issue time, never the same
physical instant" discipline throughout.

def build_train_last_obs(full_train_lead: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Builds a leakage-free `last_obs` column for every 0-24h-bucket row of
    the TRAINING reforecast archive (full_train_lead, from
    build_train_ensemble_stats_with_lead -- NOT restricted to the bucket yet,
    since step_hours=0 rows need OTHER rows of the same forecast ISSUE as
    their last_obs source).

    IMPORTANT: `time_idx` here (build_train_ensemble_stats_with_ids/_with_lead's
    naming) is the raw archive's real `time` coordinate -- confirmed (this
    project's own prior measurement, scripts/07_data_size_sweep.py's module
    docstring) to decode to genuine datetime64 values, NOT an ordinal
    position index. `year_idx` (the raw `year` coordinate) is a bare
    1..20 analog-year label with no confirmed real-calendar meaning, so all
    matching below is done WITHIN one year_idx at a time, using real datetime
    arithmetic on `time_idx` + `step_hours` only -- never assuming adjacent
    `time_idx` values are 1 apart in real time (they are real timestamps,
    spaced 72h or 96h apart per the measured template), and never crossing
    year_idx (whose real-calendar ordering is unconfirmed).

    Two cases, both using ONLY information that genuinely predates or
    coincides with the row's own forecast issue_time (never the row's own
    valid_time when that would equal issue_time):

    step_hours in {6, 12, 18}: issue_time = this row's own time_idx (the real
    issue timestamp), strictly BEFORE this row's own valid_time
    (time_idx + step_hours). The SAME forecast's own step_hours=0 row has
    valid_time == time_idx == issue_time exactly -- i.e. it IS the
    observation available at issue time. last_obs = that sibling row's
    t2m_obs (a same-(station_id, year_idx, time_idx) self-join).

    step_hours == 0: issue_time == this row's OWN valid_time (== time_idx),
    so the same forecast's own step=0 obs is the target itself and cannot be
    used. Instead this looks up ANY OTHER row in the SAME year_idx (any
    time_idx, any step_hours) whose real valid instant
    (time_idx + step_hours) equals (this row's time_idx - 6h) -- a genuinely
    earlier physical observation, via a direct datetime match rather than an
    assumed ordinal adjacency. Rows with no such match anywhere in the same
    year_idx (e.g. the very first template date, with nothing earlier to
    match against) are dropped; count reported.
