"""Render the five main figures for the ZeroPP paper (F1-F5), per
docs/figure_style_guide.md. Matplotlib only, no plotnine. One function per
figure (make_f1..make_f5), each independently callable -- this module has no
monolithic main() that must run start-to-end; __main__ below just calls all
five in sequence for convenience.

Every color, line style, marker and font size used anywhere in this file
lives in the single STYLE dict below -- no hex-color literal appears
anywhere else in this module (grep for '#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}' outside the STYLE
block as a mechanical check).

Every number that appears baked into a figure or its caption (breakpoints,
crossover lead time, coverage percentages, calendar-day equivalents, N
values at F3's arrowheads, etc.) is read at render time from the persisted
`results/*.parquet` files listed in docs/results_index.md -- never
hardcoded/retyped in this file. F4 is the one figure whose input data did
not already exist anywhere; scripts/10_compute_pit_histograms.py computes
and persists it to results/phase3_pit_histograms.parquet BEFORE this module
reads it, so the "numbers come from results files" rule holds for F4 too.

Column width note: the style guide fixes 90mm (single) / 190mm (double) as
the two allowed physical widths, set in code and never scaled after the
fact. All five figures here use the double-column (190mm) width -- each
carries multiple series, in-panel R2 annotations and (for F1/F3/F5) a
secondary axis or trajectory arrows/labels that do not fit legibly at 90mm;
first-draft renders at single-column width produced illegible, overlapping
text (see docs/figures_implementation_report.md). Heights are chosen per
figure and are NOT derived from any fixed ratio.

Exports per figure: <name>.pdf (vector, with source-parquet-path + git-SHA
written into the PDF's own metadata via savefig(metadata=...)), <name>.svg
(vector), <name>.png (300 dpi, preview only -- see .gitignore, PNGs under
figures/ are not tracked). Layout is done with explicit fig.subplots_adjust
margins (not tight_layout/constrained_layout), and every fig-level legend is
anchored at a small POSITIVE figure-fraction y (never a negative
bbox_to_anchor) so it always lands inside the fixed canvas -- tight_layout
is deliberately not used together with secondary axes / fig-level legends,
since matplotlib's own tight_layout warns it cannot account for either and
a first-draft render confirmed that in practice (clipped/overlapping
legends, an oversized blank margin on F1).

Captions (numbers substituted from the same results files, never retyped)
are collected into figures/captions.md by each make_fX call -- see
_update_caption(). F4's caption includes, verbatim, the sentence required by
docs/figure_style_guide.md: "PIT uniformity is assessed descriptively; no
formal uniformity test valid under serial dependence is applied." F3's
caption carries the Gneiting "up and to the left is better" reading (per the
style guide: "Say that in the caption" -- not on the canvas itself).
