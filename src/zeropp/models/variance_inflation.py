    """Trivial single-parameter baseline for Task 6 E1: mu = ens_mean (no mean
    adjustment), sigma = multiplier * sqrt(ens_var) -- the same Gaussian parametric
    family EMOS/DRN already use in this project (mu = a + b*ens_mean, sigma =
    sqrt(exp(c) + exp(d)*ens_var)), but with exactly ONE free scalar and the mean
    left untouched, so it is a fair "1 parameter / k cases" contrast against EMOS's
    "4 parameters / k cases".

    The point of this baseline is to check whether TimesFM-3's sharpness/coverage
    can be matched by a trivial rescaling of the raw ensemble's own reported
    spread, with no fitted mean correction and (for the fixed-multiplier variant)
    no fitting step at all.

    Two ways to obtain `multiplier`, per Task 6 E1 -- both are reported, neither is
    picked as "the" baseline:
      - fit(train): the standard second-moment-matching / spread-skill-ratio
        estimator, multiplier = sqrt(mean squared error / mean ensemble variance)
        over the training rows passed in. Callers MUST pass only a training subset
        (e.g. the same k-sized contiguous subset EMOS is fit on at each N in
        scripts/07_data_size_sweep.py) -- fitting this on test data would be
        leakage, exactly as it would be for EMOS.
      - from_fixed_multiplier(value, quantile_levels): a genuinely zero-shot
        constructor -- no fit() call, no training data at all. `value` is meant to
        be a literal constant, e.g. a published climatological ensemble
        under-dispersion inflation factor (see scripts/07_data_size_sweep.py's
        LAMBDA_CLIM constant and comment for the citation and its caveats), matching
        TimesFM-3's own zero-shot status.

    Fix-round-1 finding 4: an instance created via from_fixed_multiplier is
    PERMANENTLY fixed -- calling .fit(train) on it (e.g. by accident, or via generic
    code that calls .fit() on every Postprocessor uniformly) is a no-op that returns
    self unchanged, rather than silently overwriting the fixed multiplier with a
    data-derived one. Without this guard,
    `VarianceInflationBaseline.from_fixed_multiplier(1.5).fit(train)` would quietly
    stop being the zero-shot baseline E1(b) is supposed to be.

        that the raw ensemble's spread, scaled by lambda_c, achieves `target_coverage`
        empirical coverage@[lower, upper] -- evaluated ONLY on `train_df` (the training
        reforecast archive) against its own observations. This is deliberately the same
        leakage discipline as fit(): the multiplier is derived without ever looking at
        test-set coverage. Callers apply the returned (permanently fixed, like
        from_fixed_multiplier) instance to the TEST set afterward, exactly like variants
        (a) (`fit`) and (b) (`from_fixed_multiplier`) already do.

        `target_coverage` is meant to be a real, persisted number (e.g. TimesFM-3's
        measured coverage_80pct at [0.1, 0.9]) read from a results file by the caller,
        never hardcoded here.

        Coverage as a function of lambda is monotonically increasing (a wider interval
        can only cover more, never less, for a fixed centre) -- bracketed root-finding
        via `scipy.optimize.brentq` is used rather than a custom bisection loop, but the
        monotonicity assumption is verified on THIS data before trusting the single
        root: coverage at the bracket's low end must sit below target_coverage and
        coverage at its high end above it (the classic brentq precondition), which for
        a sensible bracket ([0.1, 10.0] lambda) also serves as the sanity check the task
        asked for (coverage near 0 at lambda=0.1, near 1 at lambda=10 for any
        reasonably-dispersed archive) -- an AssertionError here means the bracket itself
        needs revisiting for this dataset, not that root-finding silently returned a
        wrong answer.
